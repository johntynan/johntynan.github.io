Last night, I performed "Slow Down Christmas" as part of a holiday concert at [Studio Pause](https://www.studiopause.com/), a nearby arts collective.

It was a true, special pleasure to collaborate with [Victor Hurtado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victormhurtado) and the talented veterans of the [Armed Services Arts Partnership's ASAP Choir](https://asapasap.org/event/choir/).

A recording of thsi event can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEYjNJiNgCk&t=1341s)
