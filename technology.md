# Technology

I hold a Microsoft Power Platform Functional Consultant certification and am glad to practice web application development using Microsoft's Power Platform in my work.

On weekends and on the side, I have been known to follow my curiosity into different side-projects using various technologies such as linux, arduino, raspberry pi, scratch and python.

For several years, I created different halloween robots to greet trick-or-treaters.
